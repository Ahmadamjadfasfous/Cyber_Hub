    <h1>Social Engineering Techniques and Defenses</h1>
    <p>
        Social engineering attacks exploit human psychology to manipulate individuals into disclosing sensitive information or performing actions that compromise security. Understanding these techniques and knowing how to defend against them is essential in today’s digital world.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Common Social Engineering Techniques</h2>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Pretexting:</strong> Attackers create a fabricated scenario to gain the victim's trust, often impersonating a trusted authority figure.</li>
            <li><strong>Baiting:</strong> Offering something enticing, such as free software or gifts, to lure victims into providing sensitive information.</li>
            <li><strong>Phishing:</strong> Sending fraudulent emails or messages that appear to be from legitimate sources, tricking victims into revealing information.</li>
            <li><strong>Quid Pro Quo:</strong> Offering something in exchange for information, often in the form of fake tech support assistance.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>2. Defending Against Social Engineering</h2>
    <p>
        To protect against social engineering attacks:
        <ul>
            <li>Be cautious about sharing personal information with unknown sources.</li>
            <li>Verify the identity of anyone requesting sensitive information, especially over the phone or online.</li>
            <li>Educate employees and individuals on the signs of social engineering attacks.</li>
            <li>Use multi-factor authentication to add an extra layer of security.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>Case Study: The 2015 Ubiquiti Networks Scam</h2>
    <p>
        In 2015, Ubiquiti Networks lost $39 million in a social engineering scam where attackers impersonated company executives and requested large transfers to fraudulent bank accounts. This case illustrates the effectiveness of social engineering in bypassing technical security measures.
    </p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
        Social engineering remains a significant threat due to its reliance on human error. Awareness and training are the first line of defense, empowering individuals to recognize and respond effectively to manipulation tactics.
