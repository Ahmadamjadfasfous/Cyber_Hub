    <h1>Phishing Attacks: Detection and Prevention</h1>
    <p>
        Phishing attacks are one of the most prevalent cybersecurity threats today, aiming to trick individuals into providing sensitive information such as passwords, credit card details, or other personal data. As these attacks increase in sophistication, understanding how to detect and prevent them is essential for both individuals and organizations.
    </p>

    <h2>1. How Phishing Works</h2>
    <p>
        A phishing attack typically begins with an email or text message that appears to be from a trusted source, such as a bank or a popular website. These messages often contain a link directing the victim to a fake website, designed to look almost identical to the real one, where they are asked to enter personal information. Once this information is entered, attackers can use it for malicious purposes.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Types of Phishing Attacks</h2>
    <p>
        There are several types of phishing attacks:
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Email Phishing:</strong> The most common form, where attackers send fraudulent emails to deceive recipients.</li>
            <li><strong>Spear Phishing:</strong> A targeted attack aimed at specific individuals or organizations.</li>
            <li><strong>Smishing:</strong> Phishing attempts carried out via SMS text messages.</li>
            <li><strong>Vishing:</strong> Phishing conducted over the phone, often impersonating customer support.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>3. Detecting Phishing Attempts</h2>
    <p>
        Common signs of phishing attempts include:
        <ul>
            <li>Suspicious or unfamiliar sender email addresses.</li>
            <li>Generic greetings like “Dear Customer” instead of using your real name.</li>
            <li>Grammatical errors or unnatural language.</li>
            <li>Urgent messages prompting immediate action.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>4. Preventing Phishing Attacks</h2>
    <p>
        To prevent falling victim to phishing, consider these safety practices:
        <ul>
            <li>Enable two-factor authentication (2FA) for an added layer of security.</li>
            <li>Use email filtering tools to block suspicious messages.</li>
            <li>Educate employees or family members on recognizing phishing attempts.</li>
            <li>Regularly update software and systems to patch vulnerabilities.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>Real-World Phishing Attack Examples</h2>
    <p>
        In 2016, Google and Facebook fell victim to a sophisticated phishing scam in which a hacker impersonated a vendor and collected over $100 million from the companies. In 2020, phishing attacks surged by 220% during the COVID-19 pandemic as attackers exploited fear and uncertainty to trick victims.
    </p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
        Phishing relies on social engineering, exploiting trust and psychological manipulation. By being aware of the signs of phishing and implementing preventive measures, individuals and organizations can significantly reduce their risk of falling victim to these types of attacks.
