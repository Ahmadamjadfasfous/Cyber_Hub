    <h1>Introduction to Malware</h1>
    <p>
        Malware, short for malicious software, is a type of software designed specifically to harm, disrupt, or gain unauthorized access to computer systems. It encompasses a variety of types, including viruses, worms, spyware, and more, which exploit vulnerabilities in devices or software to achieve harmful goals.
    </p>

    <h2>Types of Malware</h2>
    <p>
        Malware comes in many forms, each with distinct characteristics and purposes:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Viruses:</strong> Attach themselves to clean files and spread through infected files.</li>
        <li><strong>Worms:</strong> Spread autonomously across networks and cause widespread damage.</li>
        <li><strong>Spyware:</strong> Collects data about users without their knowledge.</li>
        <li><strong>Trojan Horses:</strong> Disguise themselves as legitimate software but carry hidden harmful actions.</li>
        <li><strong>Ransomware:</strong> Encrypts files and demands payment to restore access.</li>
        <li><strong>Adware:</strong> Displays unwanted advertisements, often causing slower system performance.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>The History of Malware</h2>
    <p>
        The concept of malware dates back to the 1970s, with early viruses like the "Creeper" program, which simply displayed the message "I'm the Creeper, catch me if you can!" Over time, malware became more sophisticated, evolving from simple viruses to complex, autonomous worms and trojans, with the introduction of ransomware in recent years. These advancements underscore the need for constant updates to security protocols.
    </p>

    <h2>How Malware Works</h2>
    <p>
        Most malware is designed to remain undetected, using techniques to bypass traditional security measures. By exploiting vulnerabilities, malware gains access to sensitive information or executes harmful actions on devices. Some malware, like rootkits, go a step further by hiding their presence on infected systems, making detection even more challenging.
    </p>

    <h2>How to Protect Yourself from Malware</h2>
    <p>
        To protect your devices and data from malware, consider the following tips:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Keep your software updated:</strong> Regular updates can patch security vulnerabilities that malware might exploit.</li>
        <li><strong>Use reliable antivirus software:</strong> Antivirus programs can detect and remove many types of malware.</li>
        <li><strong>Be cautious with email attachments:</strong> Avoid opening suspicious attachments or links from unknown sources.</li>
        <li><strong>Backup your data:</strong> Regular backups can minimize data loss if malware, such as ransomware, strikes.</li>
        <li><strong>Enable firewall protection:</strong> Firewalls can block unauthorized access to your network.</li>
    </ul>
